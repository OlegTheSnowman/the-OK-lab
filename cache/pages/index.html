<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm Oleg, a blind translator and partial programmer dedicated to exploring the intersections of language, technology, and accessibility. This website serves as a hybrid space: part professional portfolio, part personal blog.</p>
<p>Here, you'll find examples of my work across different domains, showcasing accuracy, nuance, and adaptability. You'll also see my programming experiments and projects, reflecting my interest in creating accessible and functional digital solutions.</p>
<p>Through this site, I aim to share not only what I can do but also how I approach challenges as a visually impaired professional in the fields of translation and technology. I invite you to browse my work, read my thoughts, and discover how language and code can work together to create meaningful outcomes.</p>
